MikroTik EoIP implementation

Imported from https://code.google.com/p/linux-eoip/

Attention!
If you use dynamic=1 option, take attention that there is no authorization,
and it is not secure. It is not good idea to use this feature with public
ip or insecure(not completely under your control, each host) network.
